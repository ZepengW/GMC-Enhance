Unified Control · Powerful Shortcuts · Independent Tab Sessions

Global Media Control (GMC)-Enhance is a Chrome extension that supercharges Chrome's built‑in Global Media Control. It delivers true **unified control** across all your media, **global shortcuts** for instant actions, and **independent tab sessions** so each tab keeps its own playback, speed, and effect state without interference.

## Features

GMC-Enhance offers a range of features to improve your media playback experience:

- [x] **Unified Media Control**: Manage all media sessions from a single toolbar interface without switching tabs.

- [x] **Global Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts for instant control (seek, speed, volume, mute, select active video).
- [x] **Independent Tab Sessions**: Each tab maintains its own playback speed, selected target video, volume, and audio effect state—no accidental cross‑tab interference.
- [x] **Volume Control**: Adjust volume levels for individual videos, including mute/unmute options.
- [x] **Audio Effects**: Enhance audio quality by adjusting specific frequency bands (e.g., reduce vocals or boost bass).
- [x] **Floating Window**: Displays a floating window when adjusting via shortcuts, making it easy to view the current status.

### 2. Audio Effects Control

Enhance your listening experience with advanced audio controls. For example:

- Reduce vocal volume by lowering the 1kHz–4kHz frequency range.
- Boost bass by increasing low-frequency bands.

These adjustments are particularly useful for live streams or videos with unbalanced audio.

### 3. Shortcuts

GMC-Enhance supports the following keyboard shortcuts for fast, interruption‑free media control. In future versions, we will support customizable shortcuts.
