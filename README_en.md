Unified Control · Powerful Shortcuts · Independent Tab Sessions

Global Media Control (GMC)-Enhance is a Chrome extension that supercharges Chrome's built‑in Global Media Control. It delivers true **unified control** across all your media, **global shortcuts** for instant actions, and **independent tab sessions** so each tab keeps its own playback, speed, and effect state without interference.

### 2. Audio Effects Control

Enhance your listening experience with advanced audio controls. For example:

- Reduce vocal volume by lowering the 1kHz–4kHz frequency range.
- Boost bass by increasing low-frequency bands.

These adjustments are particularly useful for live streams or videos with unbalanced audio.

Features include:
- 10-Band Equalizer: Adjust frequency bands from 31Hz to 16kHz.
- Preset Management: Save, load, and delete custom EQ presets.
- Real-Time Spectrum: Visualize the current audio spectrum to help you see the effect of your adjustments.

**Tip**: By mapping shortcuts to a keyboard knob, you can achieve precise control over video progress, which was the inspiration behind this extension. Open “Manage Extensions → GMC-Enhance → Options” to capture new shortcut combinations or restore the default layout.

### 4. Icon Badges & Visual Cues

- Red-tinted icon: EQ has non-zero gain adjustments.
- Orange badge: Tab playback speed (hidden at 1×).
- Combined: Indicates both “modified EQ” and “non‑standard speed”.

### 5. FAQ (Quick Answers)

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| HUD sometimes stops updating? | When controlling a media element in a non-active tab, background polling (200ms) drives updates; active tab uses frame-driven updates. |
| Live stream seeking ignored? | Live sources suppress seek jumps and show informational state instead. |
| Speed badge missing? | Only shown when playback rate ≠ 1×; returning to 1× clears it. |
| Old preset lacked Q? | A default Q is applied; re-save to embed Q. |
